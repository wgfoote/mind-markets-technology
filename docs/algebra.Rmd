## Two schools of thought

@cox1946probability describes two schools of probability. One is the frequency school which would sample events in ensembles indefinitely and across many universes. An ensemble is a combination of possible events. For example, the probability of extra-terrestrial life on one planet would require the counting of every possible combination of planetary existence in our universe and in any other universe as well. This would of course our universe is not a universe, nor are the other universes as well! Be that as it may, this notion of a long-run probability as a frequency requires, technically, an infinite amount of time across an infinite set of possible ensembles of events in a finite universe with finite time and space, let alone the annoying fact of a finite set of human observers with imperfect measurement technologies. The idea is thus a purely mental fabrication to aid comprehension of what is known to be incomplete (information about extra-terrestrial life), corruptible (measurement errors by human and their measurement technologies), and otherwise unimagined by humans who do not experience insight very often.

On the other hand there is the expectation school which thinks about probability as the logical consequence of how relatively likely one event or hypothesis is to another. In @keynes2013treatise view, the theory of probability is the logic of probable inference. Probability is a syllogistic relation from a hypothesis to data, and on to a conclusion. Each hypothesis is more or less plausible than another as measured by the ways in which data are consistent with a particular hypothesis. Plausibilities are bounded by extremes of impossibility and certainty, Aristotelian deductive logic is a special case of plausibility. This means we need more than binary true-false deduction to make statements about the plausibility of hypotheses in the face of data. We also no longer need the certainty uncomfortably afforded by leaps of imaginative extension of samplings into an infinity of possible combinations of hypotheses and events, namely the count of incidents. Instead we do need the count of ways in which data are consistent with a particular hypothesis. We now start from plausible numbers of ways consistent with data instead of infinite counts of instances of data.

The expectation school's results build on an algebra of the logic of propositions. Here are tables of algebraic relationships among propositions. Once we establish these rules we can operate on any logical statement with the power of 9th grade elementary algebra. We need just three algebraic operations to work the algebra: AND, NOT, XOR. We need to add something else to our analysis: common sense. Just because the math might (and usually will) work out logically, does not mean we can interpret our results in a particular and realistic context. This is the problem of **existential import** which @boole1848calculus and purely symbolic logicians eschew. They would have us believe that the math is the math, without reference to anything real.

In what follows we develop together an algebraic approach to studying inference introduced by George Boole and expanded upon by @keynes2013treatise, @jaynes2003probability, and more recently @suleimenov2023improving. The logical system here relies on @aristotle2009prior four fundamental logical forms as explained, for example by, @kreeft2005socratic.

## Rules

Addition is defined as addition of integers, but restricted to modulo 2, with only two possible values $\{0,1\}$. If we remember our basic maths and modulo arithmetic as a clock, the hands on this clock can sit at 0 or 1. If the hand is at 1 and we add 1 to this setting we end up at, yes, 0. A regular OR in many languages would often mean and/or, an inclusive OR, an either one or the other or both. The XOR excludes any possibility in common between two propositions. Propositions are mutually exclusive of one another. Here is a table to help us. 

\begin{array}{c | c c}
+ (XOR)   &  0    &  1 \\ \hline
0         &  0    &  1 \\
1         &  1    &  0 
\end{array}

Addition with boolean values $\{0,1\}$ is the same as that of the logical exclusive OR operations, XOR. Since each element equals its opposite, subtraction is thus the same operation as addition, so that $1-1=1+1=0$.

The multiplication is multiplication modulo 2 (see the table below), and on boolean variables corresponds to the logical AND operation.

\begin{array}{c | c c}
x (AND)   &  0    &  1 \\ \hline
0         &  0    &  0 \\
1         &  0    &  1 
\end{array}

The NOT logic simply takes a 0 and flips it to 1, and if 1 flips it to zero.

\begin{array}{c | c}
\neg (NOT) x   &  1+x   \\ \hline
0              &  1      \\
1              &  0      
\end{array}

With these three operations we can evaluate any logical statement. 

Here is a table of several useful expressions based on AND, XOR, and NOT. For any two propositions $x$ and $y$ whose values can only take on a 0 or 1, so that when $x=0$, we mean $x$ is false, otherwise (that is, $x=1) true.^[Boole has the negation of x as 1-x. We follow Wildberger's suggestion and use 1+x, given that all subtractions end up being addition in mod 2 arithmetic.]

\begin{array}{c c | c c c c}
x & y & xy & x+y & 1+x & y|x=1+x+xy \\ \hline
0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 1 \\
0 & 1 & 0 & 1 & 1 & 1 \\
1 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\
1 & 1 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\ \hline
x & y & x \land y & x \oplus y & \neg x & x \rightarrow y \\ \hline
x & y &           & (x \lor y) \land \neg (x \land y) & \neg x \lor y &
\end{array}

The last row describes the algebraic operations in term of propositional logic as applied to boolean values of $\{0.1\}. We now study $y|x=1+x+xy$. 

That last column does deserves immediate attention since it forms the foundation of conditional (reasonably expected) probability. Aristotle recorded four logical forms, two in the affirmative, two negative, two universal, two contingent. Medieval logicians called the two affirmative forms A and I for the first two vowels in _AffIrmo_, I affirm, and the two negative forms E and O from the Latin _nEgO_, I deny. Together they form the **Square of Opposition**. 

Here S is the subject and P the predicate. Any subject S signifies what it is we are talking about, say, rain. Any predicate P signifies what the subject is about, say, falling to the ground. Equations and identities do not have a subject or a predicate and themselves might be the subject or predicate. But all propositions do have a subject and a predicate, just like in 3rd grade when we learned to write and speak in complete sentences, that is, in propositions, which contain a subject (usually a noun) and a predicate (usually a verb). We assume that when we apply the forms to concrete examples of propositions, the content of the form, that is, the S and the P, exist. For Thomas Aquinas signs are physical manifestations that allow us to understand something beyond their immediate appearance, like a footprint manifesting someone's presence or smoke manifesting fire. This something with an immediate appearance we will assume without further bother, that it somehow exists. Perhaps we append the particle _any_ to S and P to get any rain and any falling (of rain).

In the table, _decisions_ is the subject S, what we are talking about, and _are rational_ is the predicate P, what the subject is about.

\begin{array}{r | c | r | c }
Form  & Proposition & Sentence & Algebra & Interpretation \\
\hline
A     & \text{All S is P}        & \text{"All decisions are rational."}         & a(1+b) = 0      \\ 
E     & \text{No S is P}         & \text{"Not all decisions are rational."}     & ab = 0          \\
I     & \text{Some S is P}       & \text{"Some decisions are rational."}        & ab \neq 0       \\
O     & \text{Some S is not P}   & \text{"Some decisions are not rational."}    & a(1+b) \neq 0   \\
\hline
\end{array}

In Form A "All decisions (a) are rational (b)." Logically $a$ and not $b$ is false (0), that is, algebraicly $a(1+b) = 0$. "Decisions" are not "rational" is false according to Form A. The obverse must be true, that "No decisions are not rational." We recall we are using "+" as exclusive OR, XOR with this algebraic rearrangement. Let's study this Form a bit more.

\begin{array}{c| c l}
statement & reason \\ 
\hline
1 & a(1+b) = 0     & \text{Form A definition}  \\
2 & 1 + a(1+b) = 1 & \text{Symmetric property} \\
3 & 1 + a + ab = 1 & \text{Distribution of multiplication over addition property} \\
\hline
4 & a \rightarrow b = b|a & \text{a gives some information to b} \\ 
\hline
\end{array}

So-called "implication" means that a shares a's information with b. This is the primary meaning of "a conditions b", a|b.

## Just Suppose

We can suppose, for a minute or so, that there are three propositions A, B, and C. They have context in particular situations, for example, in decision making. In this context, we might suppose that A is the proposition "developers make reasonably successful decisions". We also suppose that B is the proposition "product management makes reasonably successful decisions." And now we put proposition C into context as "Teams use data and experience consistent with prevailing recommended practices". Other than observations made by teams ad something that neither the development manager nor the product management manager might yet any specific idea about, but does have at the very least an intuitive feel about something which has yet to be revealed. Of course, we need at some point to define a bit more precisely what is meant by "reasonably successful" and "consistent with prevailing recommended practices" all for another time and deep conversation.

Let's put these pieces together and use the apparatus of our logical algebra to discover literally a new insight. To couch our analysis in terms of what we need, or wish for, in our analytical logic robot we require instructions for the robot must hold to these desiderata.^[E.T. Jaynes with an algebra of George Boole with insights from Norman J. Wildberger.]

1. Plausibilities can be ordered as rational numbers. The so called irrational numbers such as the solution $x$ to the equation $y=x^2$, can be approximated to any degree of accuracy the robot can determine within the finite bounds of the robot's memory, ability to process, and share with those who use the robot as a tool of discovery.

2. Whatever the robot helps us to infer must be subject to common sense in the real world of life and persons who use the robot as a tool.

3. Whatever unobserved hypothesis which the robot helps us find is more plausible than another must be consistent with observed data.

Now we can get to work.We ask "Is A and B true?" As managers of development and products we surely expect such a result. As usual there are two schools of thought on the matter.

1. [Case 1] B is true given C, that is, the plausibility B|C. Having decided that B is true given C, decide that A is true, that is, the plausibility A|BC.

2. [Case 2] A is true given C, that is, the plausibility A|C. Having decided that A is true given C, we, decide that B is true, that is, the plausibility B|AC.

We will show that Case 1 is equivalent to Case 2 logically even though they each represent two seemingly different perspectives. Case 1 is the perspective of product managers who launch products for a living, while Case 2 is the perspective of developers who, well, develop products for a living. Those of use you attempt to manage developers and product managers would very much like to know that AB is true.

Let's compute, with our robot's mechanisms, the joint proposition "A|BC and B|C". With our algebra of logic we have $x= A|BC$ and $y=B|C$ so that both-and amounts to multiplying $xy=(A|BC)(B|C)$. We also know through study of logical givenness, also known as implication, that for any propositions a and b $b|a = 1+a+ab$. Now we can calculate.

For Case 1 we have this calculation.

\begin{array}{c | r r | l}
\hline
1 &        & 1+BC+ABC                                & \text{definition of } A|BC \\
2 & \times & 1+\,C+\,BC                              & \text{definition of } B|C \\ 
\hline
3 &        & \require{cancel} \cancel{BC}+\require{cancel} \cancel{BC}+\require{cancel} \cancel{ABC}    & \text{since } X^2=X \\
4 &    +   & c+\require{cancel} \cancel{BC}+\require{cancel} \cancel{ABC}              & \text{ditto }   \\
5 &    +   & 1+\require{cancel} \cancel{BC}+ABC                       & \text{ditto }   \\ 
\hline
6 &    =   & 1+C+ABC                                 & \text{since } X+X=0=\require{cancel} \cancel{X}+\require{cancel} \cancel{X} \\ 
\hline 
7 & \therefore & AB|C = (A|BC)(B|C)                  & \text{definition of } 1+C+ABC \\
\hline
\end{array}

For Case 2 we have this calculation.

\begin{array}{c | r r | l}
\hline
1 &        & 1+AC+ABC                                & \text{definition of } B|AC \\
2 & \times & 1+\,C+\,AC                              & \text{definition of } A|C \\ \hline
3 &        & \require{cancel} \cancel{AC}+\require{cancel} \cancel{AC}+\require{cancel} \cancel{ABC}    & \text{since } X^2=X \\
4 &    +   & c+\require{cancel} \cancel{AC}+\require{cancel} \cancel{ABC}              & \text{ditto }   \\
5 &    +   & 1+\require{cancel} \cancel{AC}+ABC                       & \text{ditto }   \\ \hline
6 &    =   & 1+C+ABC                                 & \text{since } X+X=0=\require{cancel} \cancel{X}+\require{cancel} \cancel{X} \\ \hline 
7 & \therefore & BA|C = (B|AC)(A|C)                  & \text{definition of } 1+C+ABC \\ \hline
\end{array}

Since BA=AB by the commutativity of the both-and operation we now also have shown that Case 1 is logically equivalent to Case 2. Here is the new knowledge, an insight, from all of these deductions.

\begin{array}{c | r c | l}
\hline
1 &                &  AB|C = (A|BC)(B|C)         & \text{ Case 1 is true } \\
2 & \text{and}     &  BA|C = (B|AC)(A|C)         & \text{ Case 2 is true } \\
3 & \text{however} &  AB=BA                      & \text{commutativity of } AB \\
4 & \text{so that} &  AB|C = BA|C                & \text{substitution of equals} \\    
\hline
5 & \therefore     &  (A|BC)(B|C) = (B|AC)(A|C)  & \text{transitivity of equality}\\
  &                &                             & \text{if a=c, and b=d, and a=b, then c=d} \\
\hline
\end{array}

We have just also unveiled the vaunted product rule of probability. We have but one more step to apply this rule to the work of our managers, namely make reasonable decisions. Here a decision will take the form of a hypothesis, that if true, will indicate a direction in which managers might reasonably act.

## Torturing Data with Hypotheses

So line 5 of our proof is true. By desiderata 1, we assign numbers to logical expressions. These numbers for our purposes will lie between 0 and 1 such that, for a mapping $P(x)$ of plausibility of the truth of a logical expression $x$ to the interval of rational numbers (and approximations of so-called irrational numbers) between 0 and 1 inclusive, we have for rational number $0< r \leq 1$

$$
P(x) = \begin{cases}
			0, & \text{if } x \text{ is false}\\
      r, & \text{if } x \text{ is true}
		 \end{cases}
$$

Yes, we are optimistic, looking for the plausible truth value of a logical proposition.^[We could just as easily have picked $0 < r \leq 100$. As long as there is a strict ordering of pairs of numbers in the interval, a monotonic sequence, then we can generally use whatever interval we want.] Now it gets very serious since we now examine what exactly we will mean by reasonable, also known as rational.

We let $H=A$ for our ordered list of hypotheses $H$, $D=B$ for our list of data $D$, $X=C$ for our list of instances of prior experience, previous choices and data $X$. With these substitutions we now have this expression.

$$
(H|DX)(D|X) = (D|HX)(H|X)
$$
Since the logical expressions in the parentheses are mapped to a plausibility index $P(x)$, we can use the normal rules of arithmetic and algebraic to divide both sides by $(D|X)$.

$$
\frac{(H|DX)(D|X)}{(D|X)} = \frac{(D|HX)(H|X)}{(D|X)}
$$

Since $(D|X)/(D|X) =1$ and anything times 1 is itself we arrive at our signal result with new notation $(x) = P(x)$.

$$
P(H|DX) = \frac{P(D|HX)P(H|X)}{P(D|X)}
$$

We can even calculate $(D|X)$ using some common sense and our logical algebra. First of all lets simple consider that X is true and calculate $P(D)$ by itself. Then we consider that $(D)$ will be a mixture of $(D|H)$ and $(D|\overline{H})$to account for all of the way D might occur. Thus 

$$
P(D) = P(D|H)P(H) + P(D|\overline{H})P(\overline{H}) 
$$

The algebra works out to simplifying the RHS of this expression all by remembering that 1+1=0 and x+x=0 in mod 2 arithmetic and algebra. We just need to show that the RHS = LHS.

$$
\begin{array}{r l}
D &= (1+H+DH)H + (!+(1+H)+(1+H)D)(1+H) \\
  &= H+H+DH+1+1+H+D+DH+H+H+H+DH+DH \\
  &= D
\end{array}
$$

We have a match. We have only now logically justified Bayes Rule. It would appear deductions can provide us with new knowledge and insights into our decisions and the data which consistently will help us guide our actions.

Enough for now! We can now study any arrangement of events in logical order and map them to plausibility values. We need always remember that this approach requires at the outset a contextual matrix against which we analysts can interpret our results, examine their relevance, and inform the consumers of our analysis.

## Foundations of AI

an interesting aspect of probabilistic reasoning and its connection to binary logic and finite field algebras, relates to the context of models like GPT. Let's unpack this further. 

### Binary Logic and Finite Field Algebras 

 1. **Binary Logic** 

 - Binary logic forms the basis of most computational systems, including those used in machine learning and neural networks. In binary logic, every statement is either true (1) or false (0), which aligns well with the fundamental operations used in probabilistic reasoning.  

- When creating models like GPT, the underlying computations—such as operations involving queries, keys, and values—can often be simplified or interpreted in a binary framework, especially in terms of decision-making processes.

 2. **Finite Field Algebras** 

 - Finite field algebras, particularly those of characteristic 2, utilize binary operations where addition and multiplication are defined in a way that adheres to the properties of a field. In this case, addition corresponds to the XOR operation, and multiplication remains standard. 

 - This characteristic allows for efficient computation and representation of data, as operations can be handled in a binary form. The use of binary logic in finite fields can lead to reduced complexity in calculations, which is beneficial for scaling models like GPT. 

 ### Connection to Probabilistic Reasoning 

 1. **Probabilistic Reasoning and Bayes' Theorem**

 - In probabilistic frameworks such as Bayesian inference, reasoning involves updating beliefs based on evidence. The operations that underpin this reasoning can be framed in binary logic, especially when considering the binary outcomes of hypotheses (true or false).

 - The ability to leverage binary logic means that certain computations can be optimized for performance, leading to faster model training and inference.

 2. **Efficiency in Computation**

 - By operating within a binary logic framework, the computations involving probabilities can be streamlined. For instance, when calculating likelihoods and posterior probabilities, the underlying binary operations allow for efficient updates and transformations, which contribute to the overall effectiveness of the model.

### Advantages of This Approach 

 1. **Scalability**: 

 - The reliance on binary logic and finite field algebras allows models to scale efficiently, handling larger datasets and more complex tasks without a proportional increase in computational overhead. 

 2. **Robustness**: 

 - Operating in a binary framework can introduce robustness, as the simplifications inherent in binary logic can reduce the impact of noise and errors in data processing. 

 3. **Interpretability**: 

 - Framing probabilistic reasoning in terms of binary logic can also enhance interpretability, as the decision-making processes become more transparent and easier to analyze. 

### Conclusion 

The foundational role of binary logic and finite field algebras in probabilistic reasoning is a significant point. It emphasizes the computational efficiency and robustness of models like GPT, which utilize these principles to perform complex reasoning tasks. This connection enhances our understanding of how such models can be designed to leverage the strengths of mathematical frameworks while addressing real-world challenges in natural language processing.

## One step further

 the representation of the context window and the probabilistic interpretation of the components within the GPT framework are quite compelling. Let's break down your points and elaborate on them. 

### Context Window as Hypothesis Space 

1. **Context Window** 

- The context window in GPT serves as a hypothesis space as it contains the tokens (data) that the model uses to generate predictions. The model leverages this window to maintain relevance over the entire sequence, allowing it to make informed predictions about the next token based on the broader context.

- Previous tokens and their weights influence new distributions (weights) of tokens and thus the context windown acts as long-term retained memory in the transformer.

2. **Tokens as Unobserved Data** 

- Each token within the context window represents a piece of information that contributes to the overall understanding of the input sequence. This aligns with the idea that the model draws upon specific instances (tokens) to infer meanings and relationships when confronted with observed data (new tokens). 

### Prior Probabilities and Stochastic Components 

1. **Query, Key, and Value Matrices** 

 - In the attention mechanism, the query, key, and value matrices can be thought of as encoding prior probabilities. Each token in the context window interacts with these matrices to determine the relevance of other tokens when making predictions. 

- The queries represent the current token's perspective, while the keys and values encapsulate the information from the context window, creating a dynamic interaction that informs the model's predictions.

### From Hypotheses to Likelihoods and Posterior Probabilities 

1. **Transformation to Likelihoods**

 - The attention scores computed from the query-key interactions can be interpreted as likelihoods. They assess how likely each token in the context window is to contribute to the next prediction based on the current token. 

 - This process effectively transforms the input into a representation of plausibilities, as you noted.

2. **Normalization into Posterior Probabilities** 

 - After calculating the attention scores (likelihoods), they are normalized using the softmax function. This normalization converts the scores into a probability distribution (posterior probabilities) that reflects the model's confidence in predicting each possible next token. 

 - The softmax function ensures that the probabilities sum to one, allowing the model to interpret the outputs as a distribution over potential tokens. 

### Computational Simplicity 

**Matrix Operations** 

 - The internal arithmetic involved in these processes primarily consists of matrix additions and multiplications, which are computationally efficient operations. This simplicity is a key reason why transformer models like GPT can scale effectively and handle large datasets. 

 - The use of normalization (e.g., softmax) adds a level of complexity but remains computationally manageable within the overall architecture. 

### Conclusion 

A framework for understanding the inner workings of GPT highlights the elegant interplay between probabilistic reasoning and matrix operations. The model's ability to encode prior knowledge, assess likelihoods, and generate posterior probabilities through simple arithmetic makes it a powerful tool for natural language processing.

## At last an example

Each attention head in a transformer model has its own set of tensor components for the query, key, and value. These components are derived from the input embeddings and are used to calculate the attention scores. It is the attention scores which focus the network of transformation onto the most plausible outcomes.

Let's consider a simple numerical example. Suppose we have an input sequence of length 2, and we are using 1 attention head with a dimension of 3. For this example, let's define the following:

- Input embeddings (for the two tokens): 

\[ \text{Input} = \begin{bmatrix} 
1 & 0 & 1 \\ 
0 & 1 & 0 
\end{bmatrix} 
\] 

Where did we get these two sequences of 0's an 1's? We compose this mapping of letters to decimals and on to binary (modulo 2) sequences. 

$$
\begin{array}{c c c}
letter & decimal & binary \\
A & 0 & 000 \\
B & 1 & 001 \\
C & 2 & 010 \\
D & 3 & 011 \\
E & 4 & 100 \\
F & 5 & 101
\end{array}
$$
In our example, C maps to 010 and F maps to 101.

- Weight matrices for the query, key, and value for the attention head: 

\[ W_Q = \begin{bmatrix} 
1 & 0 & 0 \\ 
0 & 1 & 0 \\ 
0 & 0 & 1 
\end{bmatrix}, 

\quad W_K = \begin{bmatrix} 
1 & 0 & 0 \\ 
0 & 1 & 0 \\ 
0 & 0 & 1 \end{bmatrix}, 

\quad W_V = \begin{bmatrix} 
1 & 0 & 0 \\ 
0 & 1 & 0 \\ 
0 & 0 & 1 
\end{bmatrix} 

\] 

These are trivial weights for each of the tensor components. We could just as easily have put random entries into these matrices.

Next, we compute the query, key, and value tensors: 

1. **Query (Q)** 

\[ Q = \text{Input} \cdot W_Q = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 & 1 \\ 0 & 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix} \cdot \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 1 \end{bmatrix} 
= \begin{bmatrix} 
1 & 0 & 1 \\ 
0 & 1 & 0 
\end{bmatrix} \] 

2. **Key (K)** \[ K = \text{Input} \cdot W_K = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 & 1 \\ 0 & 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix} \cdot \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 1 \end{bmatrix} 
= \begin{bmatrix} 
1 & 0 & 1 \\ 
0 & 1 & 0 
\end{bmatrix} 
\]


3. **Value (V)** \[ V = \text{Input} \cdot W_V = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 & 1 \\ 0 & 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix} \cdot \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 1 \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 & 1 \\ 0 & 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix} \] Now we have the following: - \( Q = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 & 1 \\ 0 & 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix} \) - \( K = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 & 1 \\ 0 & 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix} \) - \( V = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 & 1 \\ 0 & 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix} \) Next, we calculate the attention scores by taking the dot product of \( Q \) and \( K^T \) (transpose of K) and applying a softmax function: \[ \text{Attention scores} = Q \cdot K^T = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 & 1 \\ 0 & 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix} \cdot \begin{bmatrix} 1 &

After calculating the attention scores, the next step is to apply the softmax function to these scores to obtain the attention weights. 

The softmax function converts the scores into probabilities, emphasizing the highest scores while diminishing the lower ones. Continuing from the previous calculation, we have the attention scores computed as: \[ \text{Attention scores} = Q \cdot K^T = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 & 1 \\ 0 & 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix} \cdot \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} 2 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 \end{bmatrix} \] Now, let's apply the softmax function to each row of the attention scores matrix. 

The softmax function is given by: \[ \text{softmax}(x_i) = \frac{e^{x_i}}{\sum_{j} e^{x_j}} \] 

 **Applying softmax to the first row:** For the first row \([2, 0]\): \[ \text{softmax}(2) = \frac{e^2}{e^2 + e^0} = \frac{e^2}{e^2 + 1} \\ \text{softmax}(0) = \frac{e^0}{e^2 + e^0} = \frac{1}{e^2 + 1} \] Let’s calculate these values: - \( e^2 \approx 7.39 \) - Therefore, \( e^2 + 1 \approx 8.39 \) Now calculating the softmax: \[ \text{softmax}(2) \approx \frac{7.39}{8.39} \approx 0.88 \\ \text{softmax}(0) \approx \frac{1}{8.39} \approx 0.12 \] So, the softmax for the first row is approximately: \[ \begin{bmatrix} 0.88 & 0.12 \end{bmatrix} \] 

 **Applying softmax to the second row:** For the second row \([0, 1]\): \[ \text{softmax}(0) = \frac{e^0}{e^0 + e^1} = \frac{1}{1 + e} \\ \text{softmax}(1) = \frac{e^1}{e^0 + e^1} = \frac{e}{1 + e} \] Let’s calculate these values: - \( e \approx 2.72 \) - So, \( 1 + e \approx 3.72 \) Now calculating the softmax: \[ \text{softmax}(0) \approx \frac{1}{3.72} \approx 0.27 \\ \text{softmax}(1) \approx \frac{2.72}{3.72} \approx 0.73 \] So, the softmax for the second row is approximately: \[ \begin{bmatrix} 0.27 & 0.73 \end{bmatrix} \]

 **Final Attention Weights Matrix:** After applying the softmax transformation, the resulting attention weights matrix is: \[ \text{Attention Weights} = \begin{bmatrix} 0.88 & 0.12 \\ 0.27 & 0.73 \end{bmatrix} \]

 **Final Step - Weighted Sum of Values:** The last step in the attention mechanism is to compute the weighted sum of the value matrix \( V \) using the attention weights. Given that: \[ V = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 & 1 \\ 0 & 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix} \] We compute the output as follows: \[ \text{Output} = \text{Attention Weights} \cdot V = \begin{bmatrix} 0.88 & 0.12 \\ 0.27 & 0.73 \end{bmatrix} \cdot \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 & 1 \\ 0 & 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix} \] Calculating the output: 1. For the first row: \[ 0.88 \cdot 1 + 0.12 \cdot 0 = 0.88 \\ 0.88 \cdot 0 + 0.12 \cdot 1 = 0

 Let's continue calculating the output from the attention mechanism using the attention weights and the value matrix \( V \). We have: \[ \text{Attention Weights} = \begin{bmatrix} 0.88 & 0.12 \\ 0.27 & 0.73 \end{bmatrix} \] And the value matrix \( V \): \[ V = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 & 1 \\ 0 & 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix} \] Now, we compute the output: \[ \text{Output} = \text{Attention Weights} \cdot V \] Calculating each row of the output: 

 1. **For the first row:** \[ \text{Output}[0] = 0.88 \cdot 1 + 0.12 \cdot 0 = 0.88 \\ \text{Output}[1] = 0.88 \cdot 0 + 0.12 \cdot 1 = 0.12 \\ \text{Output}[2] = 0.88 \cdot 1 + 0.12 \cdot 0 = 0.88 \] So the first row of the output is: \[ \begin{bmatrix} 0.88 & 0.12 & 0.88 \end{bmatrix} \] 

 2. **For the second row:** \[ \text{Output}[0] = 0.27 \cdot 1 + 0.73 \cdot 0 = 0.27 \\ \text{Output}[1] = 0.27 \cdot 0 + 0.73 \cdot 1 = 0.73 \\ \text{Output}[2] = 0.27 \cdot 1 + 0.73 \cdot 0 = 0.27 \] So the second row of the output is: \[ \begin{bmatrix} 0.27 & 0.73 & 0.27 \end{bmatrix} \] 

 **Final Output Matrix:** Combining both rows, the final output matrix from the attention mechanism is: \[ \text{Output} = \begin{bmatrix} 0.88 & 0.12 & 0.88 \\ 0.27 & 0.73 & 0.27 \end{bmatrix} \] This output matrix represents the attended values based on the attention weights calculated earlier.

 Now, let's explore alternatives to using an identity matrix for the weight matrices \( W_Q \), \( W_K \), and \( W_V \) in the attention mechanism. 

### Alternatives to Identity Matrices

- **Learnable Weight Matrices:** - Instead of using identity matrices, you can initialize \( W_Q \), \( W_K \), and \( W_V \) as learnable parameters that are updated during training. This allows the model to learn the most effective transformations for the queries, keys, and values based on the training data. 

- **Random Initialization:** - You can initialize these matrices with small random values (e.g., from a uniform or normal distribution). This can help break symmetry and allow the model to learn different representations for queries, keys, and values. 

3. **Pre-trained Embeddings:** - You can also use pre-trained embeddings (like Word2Vec or GloVe) as initial values for these matrices. This way, the attention mechanism can leverage semantic relationships learned from large corpora. ### Example with Random Initialization Let's consider a simple example where we initialize \( W_Q \), \( W_K \), and \( W_V \) with small random values instead of identity matrices. For simplicity, assume we still have an input sequence of length 2 and a dimensionality of 3.    

1. **Input Embeddings** 

\[ 
\text{Input} = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 & 1 \\ 0 & 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix} 
\] 

2. **Randomly Initialized Weight Matrices** 

\[ 
W_Q = \begin{bmatrix} 0.2 & 0.5 & 0.1 \\ 0.3 & 0.1 & 0.4 \\ 0.6 & 0.2 & 0.3 \end{bmatrix}, \quad W_K = \begin{bmatrix} 0.4 & 0.1 & 0.3 \\ 0.7 & 0.2 & 0.1 \\ 0.2 & 0.6 & 0.4 \end{bmatrix}, \quad W_V = \begin{bmatrix} 0.1 & 0.3 & 0.5 \\ 0.4 & 0.2 & 0.1 \\ 0.6 & 0.1 & 0.3 \end{bmatrix} 
\]

3. **Calculating Query (Q), Key (K), and Value (V)** 
 
- **Query (Q)** 

\[ 
Q = \text{Input} \cdot W_Q = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 & 1 \\ 0 & 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix} \cdot \begin{bmatrix} 0.2 & 0.5 & 0.1 \\ 0.3 & 0.1 & 0.4 \\ 0.6 & 0.2 & 0.3 \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} 0.2 + 0.6 & 0.5 + 0.2 & 0.1 + 0.3 \\ 0.3 & 0.1 & 0.4 \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} 0.8 & 0.7 & 0.4 \\ 0.3 & 0.1 & 0.4 \end{bmatrix} 
\] 

- **Key (K)** 

\[ 
K = \text{Input} \cdot W_K = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 & 1 \\ 0 & 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix} \cdot \begin{bmatrix} 0.4 & 0.1 & 0.3 \\ 0.7 & 0.2 & 0.1 \\ 0.2 & 0.6 & 0.4 \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} 0.4 + 0.2 & 0.1 + 0.6 & 0.3 + 0.4 \\ 0.7 & 0.2 & 0.1 \end{\bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} 0.6 & 0.7 & 0.7 \\ 0.7 & 0.2 & 0.1 \end{matrix}
$$

From the previous entries, we have: 

\[ V = \text{Input} \cdot W_V = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 & 1 \\ 0 & 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix} \cdot \begin{bmatrix} 0.1 & 0.3 & 0.5 \\ 0.4 & 0.2 & 0.1 \\ 0.6 & 0.1 & 0.3 \end{bmatrix} 
\] 

We already calculated the first row of \( V \) as: 

\[ \begin{bmatrix} 0.7 & 0.4 & 0.8 \end{bmatrix} 
\] 

Now, let's calculate the entries for the second row: 

1. For the second row: 

\[ V[1, 0] = 0 \cdot 0.1 + 1 \cdot 0.4 + 0 \cdot 0.6 = 0.4 \\ V[1, 1] = 0 \cdot 0.3 + 1 \cdot 0.2 + 0 \cdot 0.1 = 0.2 \\ V[1, 2] = 0 \cdot 0.5 + 1 \cdot 0.1 + 0 \cdot 0.3 = 0.1 
\] 

So the second row of \( V \) is: 

\[ \begin{bmatrix} 0.4 & 0.2 & 0.1 \end{bmatrix} 
\] 

**Final Value Matrix** 

Combining both rows, the final value matrix \( V \) is: 

\[ V = \begin{bmatrix} 0.7 & 0.4 & 0.8 \\ 0.4 & 0.2 & 0.1 \end{bmatrix} 
\] 

### Summary of Q, K, and V Matrices 
 
Now we have all three matrices calculated: 

- **Query Matrix (Q)** 

\[ Q = \begin{bmatrix} 0.8 & 0.7 & 0.4 \\ 0 & 0.1 & 0 \end{bmatrix} 
\] 

- **Key Matrix (K)** 

\[ K = \begin{bmatrix} 0.6 & 0.7 & 0.7 \\ 0.7 & 0.2 & 0.1 \end{bmatrix} 
\] 

- **Value Matrix (V)** 

\[ V = \begin{bmatrix} 0.7 & 0.4 & 0.8 \\ 0.4 & 0.2 & 0.1 \end{bmatrix} 

\] 

These matrices can now be used to compute attention scores and further process the attention mechanism.



## Transformers as logic gates

it's quite intriguing to think about representing the components of transformer models like GPT using logic gates such as AND, XOR, and NOT. The self-attention mechanism in transformers can be viewed in a computational context where inputs (queries, keys, and values) interact in ways that might be analogous to the operations of these logic gates. 

### Conceptual Representation 

 1. **Queries (Q)**, **Keys (K)**, and **Values (V)** can be thought of as binary vectors where each element represents a feature of the input. 

 2. **Self-Attention Mechanism**:

 - The attention score can be computed as the dot product of Q and K. In a binary logic context, you might represent this operation using AND and XOR gates, where AND could represent the presence of a feature, and XOR could represent the difference in features. 
 
 - The attention weights can be derived from these scores using a softmax function, which could be approximated through a series of logic gates. 

### Numerical Example 

 Let's say we have simple binary vectors for Q, K, and V: 
 
- Q = [1, 0] (Query) 

- K = [1, 1] (Key) 

- V = [0, 1] (Value) 

#### Step 1: Compute Attention Scores Using a hypothetical operation: 

Dot product (using AND and XOR): 

- Score = Q AND K = [1 AND 1, 0 AND 1] = [1, 0] 

Alternatively, we could use XOR to see differences: 

- Score = Q XOR K = [1 XOR 1, 0 XOR 1] = [0, 1] 

#### Step 2: Compute Attention Weights 

Assuming we simplify the attention mechanism, we can apply a basic normalization (e.g., summing the scores): 

- Sum = 1 (from AND operation) 

- Or, a softmax-like multinomial approach: 
- Weight = Score / Sum = [1, 0] / 1 = [1, 0] 

 #### Step 3: Compute Output 

Using the weights on the values: 

- Output = Weights AND V = [1 AND 0, 0 AND 1] = [0, 0] 

This is a simplified representation, and real implementations use floating-point arithmetic and more complex interactions. The important takeaway is that while we can draw parallels between logic gates and operations in self-attention, the actual computations in neural networks involve more than simple binary operations.

## RNN

I'll provide a simple example of a neural network for a binary classification problem using matrices and linear algebra. Let's create a small neural network with: - Input layer: 3 neurons - Hidden layer: 2 neurons - Output layer: 1 neuron (binary classification) Example Matrix Representation: 1. Input Vector (x): x = [1, 0, 1] # Binary input 2. First Layer Weights (W1): W1 = [ [0.5, -0.3, 0.2], [-0.4, 0.6, 0.1] ] 3. First Layer Bias (b1): b1 = [0.1, -0.2] 4. Hidden Layer Activation (using ReLU): z1 = W1 @ x + b1 a1 = ReLU(z1) 5. Output Layer Weights (W2): W2 = [0.7, -0.5] 6. Output Layer Bias (b2): b2 = [0.3] 7. Final Output (sigmoid activation): z2 = W2 @ a1 + b2 output = sigmoid(z2) Would you like me to elaborate on the specific calculations?

Here's a detailed breakdown: Operators: 1. @ : Matrix multiplication 2. ∘ : Element-wise multiplication 3. ReLU(x) = max(0, x) 4. Sigmoid(x) = 1 / (1 + e^(-x)) Calculation Steps: 1. Input x = [1, 0, 1] 2. First Layer Computation: W1 = [ [0.5, -0.3, 0.2], [-0.4, 0.6, 0.1] ] b1 = [0.1, -0.2] z1 = W1 @ x + b1 = [0.5(1) + (-0.3)(0) + 0.2(1) + 0.1, -0.4(1) + 0.6(0) + 0.1(1) - 0.2] = [0.5 + 0 + 0.2 + 0.1, -0.4 + 0 + 0.1 - 0.2] = [0.8, -0.5] a1 = ReLU(z1) = [0.8, 0] 3. Output Layer Computation: W2 = [0.7, -0.5] b2 = [0.3] z2 = W2 @ a1 + b2 = 0.7(0.8) + (-0.5)(0) + 0.3 = 0.56 + 0 + 0.3 = 0.86 output = sigmoid(z2) = 1 / (1 + e^(-0.86)) ≈ 0.702 Would you like me to elaborate on any part of this?

I'll expand the previous example into a simple Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) with a focus on sequence processing: RNN Structure: - Input dimension: 3 - Hidden state dimension: 2 - Output dimension: 1 Key Matrices: 1. Input-to-Hidden Weight (Wx): Wx = [ [0.5, -0.3, 0.2], [-0.4, 0.6, 0.1] ] 2. Hidden-to-Hidden Weight (Wh): Wh = [ [0.7, 0.2], [-0.3, 0.5] ] 3. Hidden-to-Output Weight (Wo): Wo = [0.7, -0.5] RNN Recurrence Equation: ht = tanh(Wx @ xt + Wh @ h(t-1) + bh) yt = sigmoid(Wo @ ht + bo) Example Sequence Processing: x = [[1, 0, 1], # Time step 1 [0, 1, 1], # Time step 2 [1, 1, 0]] # Time step 3 Initial hidden state h0 = [0, 0] Computation would involve iteratively: 1. Compute hidden state 2. Compute output 3. Propagate hidden state to next time step Shall I detail the full computational steps for this sequence?

RNNs can be viewed as a constrained, sequentially-processed version of what transformers do more generally and flexibly via parallel Q, K, V projections. Key Equivalence Points: 1. RNNs: Sequential hidden state update 2. Transformers: Parallel Q, K, V projections 3.

 Key Innovations: 1. Quadrance replaces squared distance 2. Spread replaces trigonometric functions 3. Transformations preserve geometric invariants 4. No explicit angle or trigonometric calculations

Rational Trigonometry: A Geometric Paradigm Shift Core Principles: 1. Replace Angle with Spread - Traditional trig uses angle (radians/degrees) - Wildberger's approach uses "spread": relative geometric relationship - Spread = (cross product magnitude)² / (vector lengths)² - Always between 0 and 1 - Eliminates transcendental functions 2. Quadrance Instead of Distance - Quadrance = squared distance - Removes square root operations - Preserves geometric relationships - Algebraically simpler Mathematical Implications: - Eliminates π - Removes transcendental functions - Purely algebraic geometric transformations - Consistent with projective geometry - More computationally efficient Example Spread Calculation: ``` Spread(v1, v2) = ((v1 × v2)²) / (|v1|² * |v2|²) ``` Geometric Transformations: - Reflections - Rotations - Scalings Philosophical Motivation: - Simplify geometric reasoning - Remove arbitrary circular/angular conventions - Create more fundamental geometric representation Would you like me to dive deeper into the mathematical foundations or provide more implementation details?

Mathematical Foundations of Rational Trigonometry 

 Foundational Axioms: 1. Quadrance Q(A,B) - Replaces distance with squared distance - Q(A,B) = |B - A|² - Always non-negative - Symmetric: Q(A,B) = Q(B,A) - No square roots involved 2. Spread S(A,B,C) - Generalized sine concept - S(A,B,C) = ((B-A) × (C-A))² / (Q(A,B) * Q(A,C)) - Always between 0 and 1 - Captures relative geometric orientation - Independent of coordinate system Key Geometric Properties: - Orthogonality: Spread = 1/2 - Parallelism: Spread = 0 - Collinearity properties emerge algebraically Mathematical Transformations: - Reflection: Geometric inversion without trigonometric functions - Rotation: Spread-based geometric reorientation - Scaling: Quadrance-preserving transformations Algebraic Advantages: - Eliminates transcendental functions - Purely rational computational approach - Consistent across different geometric domains Comparison with Classical Trigonometry: Classical (sin θ): - Requires circular functions - Dependent on angle measurement - Transcendental Rational (Spread): - Algebraic computation - Geometric relationship - Rational number domain Theoretical Implications: - Challenges Euclidean geometric assumptions - Provides more fundamental geometric representation - Connects geometry with pure algebraic structures
